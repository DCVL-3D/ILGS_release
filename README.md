## :eyes: Overview

We propose **Identity-aware Language Gaussian Splatting (ILGS)**, a simple yet powerful method to resolve view-inconsistent language embeddings for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

ILGS introduces two key components: an **identity-aware semantic consistency loss** to ensure consistent features across views, and a **progressive mask expanding** scheme for precise boundary segmentation.

We provide:

- âœ… **Full Implementation**: The complete source code for ILGS.
- ðŸª„ **3D Editing**: Examples of object removal, color modification, and resizing.

## ðŸ’¿ Installation

For detailed instructions on how to set up the environment and install dependencies, please refer to our [Installation.md](documents/Installation.md) 

## ðŸ“‚ Download

We provide guidelines to download datasets. </br>
Please check [Download.md](documents/Download.md) for more information.

## âœ… Full Implementation

To get started with the full implementation of our open-vocabulary segmentation model, please follow the instructions in the [Implementation.md](documents/Implementation.md).


## ðŸª„ 3D Editing 
For instructions on our 3D editing features, please refer to the [Editing.md](documents/Edit.md). This guide explains how to launch the interactive demos and use functionalities like object removal, color modification, and resizing.
