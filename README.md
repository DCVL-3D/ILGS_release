## :eyes: Overview

We propose **Identity-aware Language Gaussian Splatting (ILGS)**, a simple yet powerful method to resolve view-inconsistent language embeddings for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

ILGS introduces two key components: an **identity-aware semantic consistency loss** to ensure consistent features across views, and a **progressive mask expanding** scheme for precise boundary segmentation.

We provide:

- âœ… **Full Implementation**: The complete source code for ILGS.
- ðŸª„ **3D Editing Demos**: Examples of object removal, color modification, and resizing.

## Installation

Please refer to [Installation.md](documents/Installation.md) for installation.

## Download

We provide guidelines to download datasets. </br>
Please check [Download.md](documents/Download.md) for more information.

## âœ… Full Implementation
