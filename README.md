## :eyes: Overview

[cite_start]We propose **Identity-aware Language Gaussian Splatting (ILGS)**, a simple yet powerful method to resolve view-inconsistent language embeddings for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

[cite_start]Our key idea is an **identity-aware semantic consistency loss**, which aligns language embeddings for the same object across different views, We also introduce a **progressive mask expanding** scheme to accurately preserve object boundaries.

We provide:

- [cite_start]ðŸš€ **Full implementation** of ILGS [cite: 15]
- [cite_start]ðŸŽ¨ **Demos** for 3D scene editing (removal, color/size modification)
